### I solved the questions of my college asignment and all the questions are present inside the [doc](https://github.com/prettyquail/JAVA/blob/main/java_ASSIGNMENT_2020.docx)

### And the directory Final consists of more than 100 programs in java alongwith their (.class) files. You can install this folder into your machine and run the java programs without compiling it.
